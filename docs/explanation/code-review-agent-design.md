# Designing the code-review agent (Quinn)

This is a due-diligence benchmark of our in-process PR-review agent, **Quinn**,
against the state of the art (2025–2026), plus a prioritized roadmap. It pairs
external research with live observability pulled from `events.db`.

Quinn is a LangGraph ReAct DeepAgent. On every PR she runs `pr_inspector`
(CI status + CodeRabbit threads + diff summary), optionally runs `clawpatch_review`
(our AST/structural review fork), produces a `VERDICT`, and submits a formal GitHub
review (`APPROVE` / `COMMENT` / `REQUEST_CHANGES`) that feeds the auto-merge-on-green
loop.

## Live baseline (events.db, ~7 days)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| pr_review runs | 1,523 (~217/day) |
| Completed | 1,498 (98.4%) |
| Failed | 25 (1.6%) — **24 of 25 are "Recursion limit of 37 reached"**, 1 timeout |
| Verdict mix | COMMENT 51% · APPROVE 43% · REQUEST_CHANGES 2.6% |
| Tool-calls / review | median 3, p90 4, max 15 |
| Tool frequency | `pr_inspector` 4,590 · `react` 94 · **`clawpatch_review` 83** · `send_update` 48 |
| clawpatch usage | **~5% of reviews** |
| Latency | avg ~44s, max ~7 min (the thrash tail) |

Two facts stand out: Quinn is effectively a **diff-only reviewer 95% of the time**
(clawpatch, her structural pass, rarely fires), and her only meaningful failure mode
is the **recursion-limit thrash that produces no verdict** and stalls the PR.

## What the field does

### Architecture — diff-only vs whole-repo context

The biggest quality lever. [Greptile](https://www.greptile.com/agent) indexes the
whole repo into a graph (parses the AST, recursively generates per-node docstrings,
embeds them) and runs a swarm of agents doing **multi-hop investigation** — tracing
dependencies, checking git history, following references across files (v3 built on the
Claude Agent SDK). [Benchmarks](https://www.greptile.com/benchmarks) put graph-context
Greptile at **82% catch rate vs CodeRabbit's 44%** (diff-only). Systemic, cross-file
bugs are exactly where diff-only reviewers fail.

**Quinn's `clawpatch` is the structural analog — but at 5% usage it is not the
engine.** The tools that win run structural analysis as the *default* pass.

### Multi-agent specialization

[Cloudflare's production system](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-code-review/)
(48,095 MRs / 30 days) runs **seven scoped reviewers** (security, performance, code
quality, docs, release, compliance) + a coordinator, *"rather than relying on one model
with a massive, generic prompt."* Quinn is one ReAct agent wearing all hats.

### Noise reduction — the #1 complaint

Cloudflare's clearest lesson: *"telling an LLM what NOT to do is where the actual prompt
engineering value resides."* Without explicit don't-flag lists they got *"a firehose of
speculative theoretical warnings developers learn to ignore."* Their coordinator runs a
**reasonableness filter** dropping *"speculative issues, nitpicks, false positives, and
convention-contradicted findings,"* and **reads source to verify** when uncertain.
Best-in-class tools hold [5–15% false-positive rates](https://www.propelcode.ai/blog/ai-code-review-false-positives-reducing-noise)
with per-type tolerances ([security <3%, style <2%](https://www.codeant.ai/blogs/ai-code-review-false-positives)).

**Quinn is ahead of the field on grounding** — her Step 2c rule (*every HIGH/CRITICAL on
an external reference must rest on a fetched EXISTS/MISSING fact, else it's a Gap*) is the
"read source to verify" discipline, formalized. She lacks an explicit **"what NOT to
flag"** list (see the prompt-policy decision below).

### Comment-vs-block policy

Cloudflare biases *explicitly toward approval*: clean/trivial → approve; suggestion-level
→ approve-with-comments; only **critical/safety** → block. Quinn's
PASS→approve / WARN→comment / FAIL→request_changes maps almost exactly, and her live
distribution (COMMENT 51%, REQUEST_CHANGES 2.6%) confirms the correct bias. **Keep this.**

### Convergence — timeouts, not turn-limits

Cloudflare uses **per-task 5 min (10 for code quality), a 25 min overall cap, and a 60s
inactivity kill** plus heartbeat logs — and budget exhaustion still yields a *result*.
Quinn instead hits a raw LangGraph recursion cap (maxTurns=18 → 37 steps) and fails to
**nothing**, leaving the PR stuck. This is her clearest defect.

### Memory — recall → review → retain

Real but young. Cloudflare's production form is **re-review memory**: on re-review the
coordinator gets *"the full text of its last review comment and a list of inline DiffNote
comments… along with their resolution status,"* auto-resolves fixed findings, respects
"won't fix," reconsiders on "I disagree." Per-repo conventions ride in
[AGENTS.md injected into prompts](https://blog.buildbetter.ai/agents-md-complete-guide-for-engineering-teams-in-2026/).
A simpler [recall/retain loop](https://dev.to/abhiramcdivakaran/building-a-code-review-agent-that-learns-from-every-decision-5a4c)
stores `PR# | file | comment | developer-action` and suppresses repeatedly-rejected
suggestion types. **Honest caveat:** measured benefit is mostly *qualitative*
(*"the first review is average; the tenth is meaningfully better"*) — no published
precision/recall gains. Memory is a trust/consistency play, not a proven accuracy
multiplier.

**Quinn is fully stateless.** The highest-value memory is **re-review memory**, not a
fancy KB — she re-reviews the same PR from scratch every CI cycle, which both wastes
turns and is a prime cause of the recursion thrash.

### Evaluation

The field measures with **bug-hits vs valid-suggestions vs noise**
([CR-Bench / CR-Evaluator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2603.11078)), **signal-to-noise ratio**
as a trust proxy, and **suggestion-acceptance rate**. Precision is the universal hard
part (some tools <10%). Quinn has no eval harness — but we already log
`quinn.review.submitted` + `autonomous.outcome.*pr_review` + GitHub resolution state, so
the raw material exists.

## Prioritized roadmap

**P0 — fix the stuck mode**
1. **Never fail to nothing.** On budget exhaustion (recursion limit / timeout) in a
   `pr_review` run, force-emit a terminal **COMMENT** ("review incomplete — out of budget;
   partial findings below") instead of a hard error. Removes the ~1.6% of PRs that get no
   verdict and stall the merge loop.
2. **Make clawpatch deterministic, not discretionary.** Trigger it on objective signals
   (diff > N files / > N lines, or sensitive paths) rather than the model's "is this
   non-trivial?" judgement, which is under-firing it (5%).

**P1 — re-review memory** ✅ *shipped (prior-verdict recall)*
3. Before a re-review, recall Quinn's own prior verdict + which findings are resolved
   (Cloudflare's re-review contract). Cuts duplicate comments, tokens, and thrash.
   **Implemented** as a `pr_inspector(action='prior_review')` read-action: it fetches
   the reviewer bot's own latest formal verdict (state + body + reviewed SHA) and
   compares that SHA to the current head, so a re-review is incremental — reaffirm on
   an unchanged head (CI settling), or review only the delta when the head advanced —
   instead of a cold re-derivation. **GitHub-native by design** (no local memory store
   to drift): Quinn's findings live in the review *body*, so her prior verdict is the
   ground-truth recall, and the reviewed-vs-head SHA is the delta signal. This mirrors
   CodeRabbit's incremental model (*"consider all comments since the most recent review,
   review only the new changes"*) — the pipeline/orchestration angle, decoupled from the
   deterministic approve-on-green gate. The AgentMemory flywheel (a `memory:` block +
   PR-stable `contextId`) remains a separate future additive for *cross-PR* pattern
   learning, not same-PR re-review state.

**P2 — repo conventions + eval**
4. Per-repo conventions via AGENTS.md-style injected context, or wire Quinn into the
   existing `AgentMemory` flywheel (she's the one core agent without a `memory:` block)
   with a `review_finding` domain. Set expectations honestly (consistency, not precision).
5. Stand up an **eval harness** from data we already emit: per-finding resolution rate,
   SNR, verdict-vs-merge accuracy. Arguably do this *first* as the baseline.

**Keep (already at/above field):** the Step 2c grounding rule, deterministic
VERDICT→action mapping with CI-terminal gating (409→comment), approval-biased rubric,
self-review safety rail.

## Prompt-policy decision: "what NOT to flag"

The field's highest-ROI noise lever is an explicit **don't-flag exclusion list**. Our
house rule is *"prompts — no negative reinforcement / positive framing only."* These
appear to conflict.

**Decision:** carve the exception. The no-negative-reinforcement rule targets *behavioral
coaching* of the agent ("never be lazy", "don't hallucinate") — which degrades into
nagging. A **scope-exclusion list** ("the following finding categories are out of scope
for this review") is *specification*, not behavioral reinforcement: it defines the task
boundary the same way a function signature does. Review agents are the case where naming
the out-of-scope set is the single biggest signal-quality win, so Quinn's `pr_review`
prompt carries an explicit out-of-scope list. This is a deliberate, scoped exception, not
a repeal of the house rule.
